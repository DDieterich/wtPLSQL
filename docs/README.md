### What is wtPLSQL?

wtPLSQL is a testing framework designed to assist with white-box testing of Oracle database objects.  It is particularly well suited for unit testing and simple integration testing.  It is written in PL/SQL.  It can test itself (self-test), making easier to support and customize.

The [[About page|About]] has more information about the history and philosophy of wtPLSQL.

Because it is bounded by few rules, a [[Best Practices page|Best Practices]] describes some guidance for creating Test Runner packages.

The [[Core Features page|Core Features]] introduces the main functionality of wtPLSQL.

The [[Definitions page|Definitions]] includes definitions from many sources to help define the names used in software testing.

### How does wtPLSQL compare to utPLSQL V3?

utPLSQL V3 is an excellent choice for unit testing.  It is well supported and included extensive functionality.

wtPLSQL has a different focus than utPLSQL V3.  More information is available [[here||utPLSQL-V3-vs.-wtPLSQL]].
