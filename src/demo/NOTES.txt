Database Object Tests:
----------------------
Function Test
Procedure Test
Package Test
Table Constraints Test
Table Trigger Test
Type Test


utPLSQL 2.3 Examples:
---------------------
ut_calc_secs_between - Test a Simple Procedure
ut_truncit - Test a Table Modification Procedure
ut_str - Test a Simple Function
ut_del1 - Test an Entire Package
Create and Run a Test Suite - Build a Test Suite package.
ut_betwnstr - 
Version

Add-Ons:
--------
Where is UTL_FILE?
ut_setpath - Test a Collection (check ETCC code)
What about prefixes? - Because the Test Runner is completely user written, the use of prefixes is optional.
Build Test Packages
Where is Trace? - Because the Test Runner is in total control of testing and because the Test Runner is completly user written, any desired tracing can be added to the Test Runner as needed.  The simplicity of wtPLSQL execution eliminates the need for wtPLSQL tracing (small and reliable).
What do I do with all this utConfig stuff?
What happened to utResult? - It is confusing why database programmers need a package to report test results. All test results from wtPLSQL are easily reported from database tables. There is a default reporting package called WT_TEXT_REPORT that provides simple reports through DBMS_OUTPUT.

utOutput Package not implemented.
utRecEq Package not implemented.
Custom Reporter not implemented (custom developed).
